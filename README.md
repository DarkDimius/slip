# SLIP
## Scala Library Improvement Process

[![Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/scala/slip)

## Contributing a SLIP:

* Chat with us on [the gitter channel](https://gitter.im/scala/slip).
* Familiarize yourself with the SLIP mechanism:
  * [SLIP submission](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/slip-submission.html)
  * [SLIP tutorial](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/sip-tutorial.html)
* Fork this repository (scala/slip).
* Create a feature branch slip/NNN (where NNN is the number, check on the channel if not sure).
* Create a new subdirectory in your branch with the name slip-NNN (where NNN) is the number again.
* Copy the slip-template.md file into that directory and edit it with your slip proposal. Call it slip-NNN.md.
* Note that the slip-template.md file is just suggested sections, feel free to augment.
* Add any supporting resources into the slip-NNN folder - extra credit for actual implementation and test code.
* When ready, submit a pull request. The SLIP review and refinement will take place in the PR comments.
